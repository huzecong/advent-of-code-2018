# Advent of Code 2018
Solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018), mostly in Rust as a practice.

For certain problems, solutions in other languages are also provided, either because it has a much cleaner (or smart) implementation, or that I found coding in Rust too hard and too slow.

Certain problems also contain READMEs describing the algorithm (if it's worth mentioning), or tricks and pitfalls.

**Note:** Rust implementations are my first attempts to code in Rust so they might have very bad style.
