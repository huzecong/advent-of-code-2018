### Day 25: Four-Dimensional Adventure

A simple graph problem: finding the number of connected components. I constructed the graph and performed BFS, but a faster approach would be to use a [disjoint set union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) so you don't need to construct the graph at all.

The second part was unanticipated though. I had previously skipped day 24 so I had to go back and write it. Nice ending.
